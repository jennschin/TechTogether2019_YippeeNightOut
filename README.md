Yippee Night Out! is a restaurant rating app/website which addresses the major problem that current popular rating sites have from a user's perspective.

Reviews and ratings are lengthy, arbitrary, and focus on areas that users don't always care about. Ratings are inherently biased by the reviewer's demographic (for example, a college student will give a college dive a very different rating than will a professor at that college). Ratings are also inherently arbitrary because in the same way that teachers/professors have very different ideas of what constitutes A-work (or B-work, or C-work, etc.) in class, so restaurant reviewers have different ideas. If the server forgets to gives the customer napkins, should a star get deducted? Even if the reviewer deducts a star in annoyance, do all users really care about a small blip in service on a busy night if the food and atmosphere is enjoyable? These examples illustrate the arbitrary nature of ratings on Yelp and competitors such as TripAdvisor.

Sometimes, you just want a hearty oxtail stew. Or an authentic Hyderabadi biryani. Or a real Chicago deep-dish... while visiting New York. You could search Yelp for Korean restaurants, search through incomplete menus and make calls to confirm which restaurants have oxtail stew, and hope that the only restaurant that serves oxtail stew in the area has good, satisfying oxtail stew... even though it's primarily a Korean Barbecue joint. 

Yippee Night Out! will solve these problems. First, we will collect demographic details for each user, and use that data to give the user who is searching results targeted to them based on their demographic. While users write a review, instead of making them arbitrarily choose a star rating and write free-style (sometimes they write a novel), we will specify categories (such as food, cleanliness, how healthy it is, etc.), split the review into pros and cons to make it more organized and useful to readers, and give reviewers a function to give stickers in their review. When users search, those results will highlight the top stickers or "tags", so that a user can tell right away that many users have said the same thing about the restaurant they're looking at, such as: greasy food, great alcohol selection, etc. as well as for atmosphere: family-friendly, upscale, date-night, business lunch, live rock band on Friday nights, etc.

While writing reviews, reviewers will be prompted to review the specific dish or dishes they ate, as well as being prompted to upload photos. These reviews and photos will be directly associated with that specific dish from that restaurant, making the dish directly searchable and allowing users to choose their restaurant not only based on an overall rating, but on the rating of the dish that they plan to eat. 

While these will already be huge improvements over the current rating sites, we still envision further improvements in the future. Visualizations of the data and interactive filters for reviews would make the user's experience more fun and efficient. Incorporating a map application we can show users results based on location, but more visually and color-coded by rating, as well as even other things to do in the area. We could also use an aggregator of reviews from other review sites to give users an extra source of information, as well as to compare it with our data and even implement some AI features in the future.

Users will know that they can come to Yippee Night Out! and confidently have a good place to eat very quickly.
